## Slide 5: Real-World Use Cases
### Hacking the City with Vision LLM
1. **Smart Parking Notifications**: Vision LLM Camera can monitor parking lots and send automatic notifications to drivers when a space becomes available. For example, if a space opens up in a busy area, drivers nearby are immediately notified through a connected app or external service like Google Maps.
   
2. **Event Detection and Alerts**: Monitor public spaces in real time and trigger notifications based on specific events. For instance, the camera can detect gatherings or activities in front of Kamppi and notify city authorities or citizens when significant events are happening, all based on if-then conditions set by the user.

3. **Traffic Management and Dynamic Routing**: The camera monitors real-time traffic flow and can alert users to congested areas. It can also integrate with external services to suggest alternative routes or adjust traffic light patterns, improving efficiency for city planners and commuters alike.

4. **Tourism Assistance with Real-Time Alerts**: Local tourism offices can use the camera to detect when a large group of tourists gathers around a landmark. The system can then automatically send notifications with tailored suggestions, event information, or even special offers from nearby businesses.

5. **Public Safety Notifications**: Residents can set up the camera to monitor their surroundings and trigger notifications for unusual activities or potential threats. If suspicious behavior is detected near a user’s home or public space, the system can notify them immediately, providing a real-time safety solution.

6. **Environmental Monitoring and Reporting**: Vision LLM Camera can continuously analyze environmental factors such as air quality or noise levels. When certain thresholds are crossed (e.g., high pollution levels), the camera can trigger notifications to city officials or community platforms, prompting action.
